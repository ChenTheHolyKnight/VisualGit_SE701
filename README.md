# Welcome

An easy-to-use, visually-oriented desktop client for Git aimed at helping students learn the standard Git workflow.

# Installation

### Prerequisites

npm (Node Package Manager) is used to manage VisualGit's dependencies, therefore it is required to install and run VisualGit.
Follow the installation instructions below:

#### Centos-based systems
````
sudo yum install npm
````

#### Debian-based systems
````
sudo apt-get install npm
````

#### Mac
If you have homebrew installed:
````
brew install npm
````
Otherwise download and install the latest version of [Node.j](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.2.1 or later)

#### Windows
Download and install the latest version of  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.2.1 or later)

### Setup
Clone with either HTTPS or SSH:

#### SSH
````
git clone git@github.com:ElliotWhiley/VisualGit.git
````

#### HTTPS
````
git clone https://github.com/ElliotWhiley/VisualGit.git
````
then...

````
cd VisualGit
npm install
npm start
````

# Development

### TypeScript
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles into JavaScript. Most of our source files are written in TypeScript (.ts files), therefore you will need to run a TypeScript compiler to compile the source code to JavaScript (.js files) as you make changes, e.g. [typescript-compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-compiler) for Node. 

### Sass
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor with some handy extra features. All of our Style Sheets are written in Sass (.scss files), which compile into CSS (.css files). Therefore, you will need to a run a Sass-compiler to compile your .scss files into .css files as you make changes, e.g. [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) for Node.
